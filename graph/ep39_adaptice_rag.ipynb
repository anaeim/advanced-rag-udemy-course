    "A. adaptive rag a fancy word of simply using a question router to route our question to different rack flows. <br> \n",
    "So in we're going to be using two flows. <br> \n",
    "So the first one is going to be taking the route to search on the internet and then to continue downstream on the same logic we have before. <br> \n",
    "And the second round is going to be to use the retrieval augmentation from our vector store. <br>\n",
    "So we're first going to take the user's question, and we're going to decide whether the information is stored in the vector store to answer that question. And if it's not, we're simply going to take the route to web search and answer from there. <br>\n",
    "you use `question_router` chain in `./chains/router.py` script to decide which route is more appropriate for this question."
